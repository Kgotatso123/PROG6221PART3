A number of significant adjustments were made to improve the application's usability and design thanks to the lecturer's feedback. A more clean and user-friendly experience was created by updating the user interface. This required making changes to the XAML layout in order to ensure a neat, orderly look and simple navigation. To better assist users, placeholder text handling was introduced to the text boxes. To better manage user interactions, such uploading recipes, presenting recipe data, and applying filters, the C# code-behind was updated. In line closer with best practices in UI/UX design, these modifications enhanced the application's overall functionality and made it more visually appealing and easy to use.
